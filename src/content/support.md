## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where is my data stored?

All your data is stored locally on your device. We don't have servers that store your checklists - everything stays on your phone or in your browser. This means your data is private and only accessible to you.

### Will my data sync between devices?

Since all data is stored locally, it doesn't automatically sync between devices. However, you can use the Import/Export feature to manually transfer your checklists between devices by copying and pasting the exported data.

### What happens if I uninstall the app?

If you uninstall the app, all your locally stored data will be permanently deleted. We recommend exporting your checklists before uninstalling if you want to keep them.

### How do I backup my checklists?

Use the Import/Export feature in the app. Tap the export button to copy your checklist data to your clipboard, then paste it somewhere safe (like a notes app or email to yourself). You can import this data later to restore your checklists.

### Can I share my checklist with friends?

Yes! Use the export feature to copy your checklist data, then share it via any messaging app. Your friends can then import it into their own RaveChecklist app.

### Why did my checklist disappear?

Checklists are stored in your browser's or app's local storage. They can be lost if you clear your browser data, use private/incognito mode, or uninstall the app. Always export important checklists as a backup.

## About Local Storage

RaveChecklist is built with a **local-first** approach. This means:

- Your checklists are stored directly on your device
- No account or sign-up required
- Your data is completely private - we can't see it
- The app works offline
- No servers to go down or data breaches to worry about

The tradeoff is that you're responsible for backing up your data if you want to keep it. Use the export feature regularly to save your checklists!
