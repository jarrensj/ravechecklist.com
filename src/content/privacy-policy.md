# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: February 14, 2026*

## Introduction

RaveChecklist ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with our mobile application and website (collectively, the "Service").

## Data We Collect

### Mobile Application

Our mobile app is designed with privacy as a core principle. **We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to external servers.**

All data you create in the app is stored locally on your device only:

- Checklists and checklist items you create
- Categories and custom category configurations
- Item notes and completion status
- App preferences and settings

This data is stored using your device's local storage (AsyncStorage) and is never transmitted to our servers or any third parties. When you uninstall the app, all locally stored data is permanently deleted.

### Website

Our website similarly stores checklist data locally in your browser's storage. We do not require account creation or collect personal information.

## Analytics and Tracking

We do not use any analytics services, tracking pixels, or third-party tracking tools in our mobile application. Your usage of the app remains completely private.

## Third-Party Services

Our mobile app does not integrate with any third-party services, cloud storage providers, or external APIs. All functionality operates entirely on your device.

## Permissions

The mobile app requests minimal permissions:

- **Clipboard Access:** Used only when you explicitly choose to export or import checklist data. This allows you to copy your checklist data to share with others or paste data from another source.

We do not access your camera, photos, location, contacts, microphone, or any other sensitive device features.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your data to third parties. Since all your data is stored locally on your device, we have no access to it.

## Data Security

Your data is as secure as your device itself. Since we don't transmit or store your data on external servers, there is no risk of server-side data breaches affecting your information.

## Children's Privacy

Our Service is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since we don't collect personal information from any users, this concern does not apply to our Service.

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over it:

- **Access:** All your data is visible within the app at any time
- **Export:** You can export your data using the app's built-in export feature
- **Delete:** You can delete individual items, clear all data within the app, or uninstall the app to remove all data
- **Portability:** Export your data and import it on another device

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
